Scalear
=======

## What is it?
It is very simple, guitar (or other string instrument) players learn scales and chords as pictures. So this will make simple displaying of scales and chords, and easy print.

*Second purpose is modern technology demonstrator.*

Inspired by http://www.all-guitar-chords.com/ and others.

## Browser support
Current version of Internet Explorer (11) is still problematic, and it is still pain to make app working on it, so pardon me, but I can't promise it.
Older version are even worst.

## Technology
No frameworks, only pure JavaScript and SVG.

## Running version
